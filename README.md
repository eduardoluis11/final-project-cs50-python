## Instructions

You need to use Python 3.11 or older. YOU SHOULD NOT USE PYTHON 3.12 NOR NEWER VERSIONS OF PYTHON. This game runs on Pygame, and Pygame cannot be installed if you use any version of Python newer than Python 3.11. Therefore, use Python 3.11.4, or any older version of Python. It should run well on Python 3.9.

Install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file to be able to run my Python game. You can choose to either use a virtual environment, or just install the pip packages on your local machine.
