""" Final Project: Gold Standard - A video game made in Python

I will make “Gold Standard” (WORKING TITLE, it may be subject to change): a game inspired by Mother 2, which teaches
about economics.

For this project though, I will focus on just making the gameplay aspect of it. I won’t put the lore, nor story, nor
dialogues (if I don’t have the time).

I will make my game using Pygame.

I will use copyright free / royalty free music, sprites, and other assets.

To simplify things, I will put only 1 battle: a boss battle.

I’ll just focus on adding turn based combat, and that you need a strategy to win. Then, I will think about how to
implement mother 3’s musical combat into my game.

I will first just render a black screen when you execute the game.

I will simply imitate the “Press Start” or “Intro” screen from Clear Code’s 4-hour long pygame tutorial (source: Clear
Code on YouTube at  https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk?si=mfCvPMEh2o7MNjM0 ). In that screen, there’s only text (like the
game’s name and the instructions), and the player’s sprite. That’s all that I need for the boss battle for the game
I want to make: the sprite of the enemy, and text, which will represent the player. I will look at the 4 hour long
tutorial, and just find out how to make the “Press Start / Intro” screen with the player sprite and the text. I will
later replace the player sprite with a red rectangle for the enemy, and I will later put all the text below the enemy
in a box to represent the player character.

I will use a 576p resolution to make a test for the game's window. The 576p resolution has 720 x 576 px as dimensions
(source: Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution).

import pygame

from sys import exit  # If I want to exit the game properly, I'll use sys.exit()

# All of this code should make it so that a black screen shows up when you execute this python script (source:

pygame.init()

# This will render any screen / window, be it the battle screen, the press start screen, etc
game_window = pygame.display.set_mode((720, 576))

# This will add the game's title to the window's tab
pygame.display.set_caption("Gold Standard")

while True:  # Infinite loop that will pretty much make the entire game run

    # For any input taken by the user (such as clicking the mouse or closing the window)
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:  # If the user clicks "X" on the window's tab to close the game

            # This will efficiently close the game
            pygame.quit()
            exit()

    # If no input is detected by the user (if they don't click nor press any keys

    # This should render the game's window, and every sprite
    pygame.display.update()

# End of the snippet that renders a black screen once you execute a pygame game (source:
